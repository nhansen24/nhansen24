👋 Hi, I’m Nate - @nhansen24 <br>
👀 I’m interested in backend application development using C++ <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 - It is a lesser language but brings its own syntax benefits... <br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OpenSource projects for data analysis <br>
⚡ Fun fact: College taught me that I know near nothing relative to the global scope of things, <br>overwhelming at first but learning to learn can be invaluable...
